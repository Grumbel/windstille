- add bison checks

- collision detection
- virtual tiles in the editor
- animated tiles

Input Handling:
---------------
- add option to configure dead zone
- implement proper dead-zone in input handling
- allow to load multiple controller config files

Sound Handling:
---------------
- split music, voice and sound fx into seperate context or allow to
  change their volume by other means

Screen Handling:
----------------
- using a screen size != 800x600 breaks the lighting
- using a screen size != 800x600 loads to ugly fonts, should render
  the fonts so that we get 1:1 pixel mapping, can be just calculate
  their needed size and blit with floats, or do we need magic to blit
  with ints to avoid rounding errors?

Misc:
-----

- rewrite the file reading/writing to look more like that in Pingus
  (i.e. no toying around with evil pointers, weirdo iter objects,
  etc. just FileReader)
- polish/test scripting interface
- create doll class
- figure out how to do background animation (coroutines, multiple VM, etc.)
- provide decent default keyboard config
- polish dialog system
- a mission that is playable
- polish PDA
- bone animation
- add "save options" button
- reduce tilesize of the large sets, figure out a easy way to resize
  them without messing up alpha
- print and println behave different on console
- calling functions as character scripts instead of files doesn't work
- change the game to a righthand coordinate system
