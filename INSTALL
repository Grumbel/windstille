Windstille Compilation
======================

To compile Windstille you need:

 * OpenAL
 * OpenGL
 * SDL
 * SDL_image
 * freetype
 * libpng
 * physfs
 * boost
 * scons

In most cases these will come with your distribution.

The game does not support installation right now, just compile with:

 $ scons

and run it from inside its source directory with:

 $ ./windstille

# EOF #
