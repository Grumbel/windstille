Windstille Compilation
======================

Hardware Requirements
=====================

Minimal requirements are:

 * Geforce2MX
 * 1GHZ Athlon

The game will not work with a MatroxG450 and hasn't been tested with
ATI cards.


Compilation
===========

To compile Windstille you need:

 * OpenAL
 * OpenGL
 * SDL
 * SDL_image
 * freetype
 * libpng
 * physfs
 * boost
 * scons
 * bison (bison++ will not work)
 * flex
 * gtkmm (for the editor only)
 * gtkglextmm (for the editor only)

In most cases these will come with your distribution. In Ubuntu you
can install them with:

 % sudo apt-get install \
     bison \
     flex \
     libboost-dev \
     libboost-signals-dev \
     libboost-thread-dev \
     libfreetype6-dev \
     libphysfs-dev \
     libsdl-image1.2-dev \
     libsdl1.2-dev \
     scons \
     libpng12-dev \
     libopenal-dev \
     libgtkmm-2.4-dev \
     libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev \
     libmagick++-dev \
     libcurl4-gnutls-dev \
     xcftools \
     libglew1.5-dev \
     libogg-dev \
     libvorbis-dev

For compilation type:

 % scons

and run it from inside its source directory with:

 % build/windstille -d data/


Installation
============

Installation isn't currently supported, run the executables directly from the source tree.
