Windstille Compilation
======================

To compile Windstille you need:

 * OpenAL
 * OpenGL
 * SDL
 * SDL_image
 * freetype
 * libpng
 * physfs
 * boost
 * scons
 * bison (bison++ will not work)
 * flex
 * gtkmm (for the editor only)
 * gtkglextmm (for the editor only)

In most cases these will come with your distribution. In Ubuntu you
can install them with:

 % sudo apt-get install \
     bison \
     flex \
     libboost-dev \
     libboost-signals-dev \
     libboost-thread-dev \
     libfreetype6-dev \
     libphysfs-dev \
     libsdl-image1.2-dev \
     libsdl1.2-dev \
     scons \
     libpng12-dev \
     libopenal-dev \
     libgtkmm-2.4-dev \
     libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev

For compilation type:

 % scons

and run it from inside its source directory with:

 % ./windstille
